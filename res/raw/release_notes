<h4>Evercam Play - IP Camera Viewer</h4>
<h6>Version 1.1.2</h6> 

We've been working to get Evercam Play up and running as a standalone app, so we've included the ability to add, edit and delete cameras all from within the app.  
You can still view all your cameras online but you can do it here too now.
